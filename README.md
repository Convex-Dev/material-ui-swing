## Description
A modern, Material Design UI for Java Swing

Skins JComponents to have a Material Design Look and Feel. Most components are responsive, with hover effects, and click effects (no ripple unfortunately). Fonts included.

Check `src/integration.gui.mock.MaterialUISwingDemo.java` for a slightly longer example of how to use this library (an explanation of what everything means/does).
For a real-world example of usage, see [here](https://github.com/atarw/washer-chess).

This look and feel implement an method for theming personal, don't use the MetalTheme but implements
the complete system.

For the moment not is scheduler a documentations and this is considered a version alpha, if you want to
try the implement a theme for this look and feel, you can extend the abstract class AbstractMaterialTheme implement
the methods abstract, for more info look theme mlaf.thmes.MaterialLiteTheme

For a change the theme to runtime you can use this code
```
 if (UIManager.getLookAndFeel() instanceof MaterialLookAndFeel){
     MaterialLookAndFeel.changeTheme(new MaterialOceanicTheme());
 }
```
  Look the example inside the test/java/integration/gui/mock
